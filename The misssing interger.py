#This is a demo task.
#Write a function:
#def solution(A)
#that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
#For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
#Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
#Given A = [âˆ’1, âˆ’3], the function should return 1.
#Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
#each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].

    if(len(A)==0):
        return 1
    A.sort()
    if(A[0]!=1):
        return 1
    for i in range(1,len(A)):
        if(A[i]-A[i-1])>1:
            return A[i-1]+1
